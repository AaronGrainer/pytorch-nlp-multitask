This project showcases the codebase required to train and serve a Pytorch Multitask Natural Learning Processing model using AI Platform, a few tweaks are required here to adopt Pytorch as AI Platform is mainly used alongside Tensorflow. 

## Multitask Learning

Multitask Learning is an approach to inductive transfer that improves generalization by using the domain information contained in the training signals of related tasks as an inductive bias.

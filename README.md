# Pytorch NLP Multitask Learning

This project showcases the codebase required to train and serve a Pytorch Multitask Natural Learning Processing model using AI Platform, a few tweaks are required here as AI Platform is mainly used alongside Tensorflow. Special thanks to [Jason Phang](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zphang/zphang.github.io/blob/master/files/notebooks/Multi_task_Training_with_Transformers_NLP.ipynb) for the HuggingFace multitask code! NLP Multitask learning was too exciting to pass by.

# Pytorch NLP Multitask Learning

A simple adaptation of the multitask learning from ![Jason Phang](https://colab.research.google.com/github/zphang/zphang.github.io/blob/master/files/notebooks/Multi_task_Training_with_Transformers_NLP.ipynb). This project showcases the codebase required to train and serve a Pytorch Multitask Natural Learning Processing model using AI Platform, a few tweaks are required here as AI Platform is mainly used alongside Tensorflow. Special thanks to Jason for the HuggingFace multitask code! NLP Multitask learning was too exciting to pass by.
